## How to run
Ensure you have mongodb installed in your system and that it is running

### Start the backend server
Start the backend server first:

```bash
cd stockApi
npm i
npm start
```
This will run the backend server at localhost:3030. If all is working well, you should be able to access the url http://localhost:10010/items from your Browser or Postman

### Start the client
Open a separate terminal to start the client:

```bash
cd stockFront
npm start
```

Your default web browser will be launched automatically with the url http://localhost:3000
